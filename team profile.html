    <div class="placeholder1">
        <p>For assignment 3, I have formed a group with four other students. We decided to name our team Kuri, which means chestnut in Japanese. Hence, our team logo is a 
        squirrel holding a chestnut, as can be seen below. </p>
        <div class="logo">

    <h2 class="heading2"><b>Team Profile</b></h2>
    <div class="placeholder1">
        <p class="paragraph">Below are the members of our group along with our personality test results and our relevant skills for the project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Doan Yen Nhi (s3880599)</em>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relevant skills:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>Academic Research, Academic Writing</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>MBTI result: ISTP</li>
                    <p class="paragraph">The result means that I am an Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Perceiving person. This shows that I enjoy being alone more, I am quite practical 
                        and realistic, I use my logic and thinking more (especially when making decisions), and I tend to not be very organized but more flexible.</p>
                </ul>

            <li><em>Nguyen Hoang Linh (s3880313)</em>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relevant skills:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python, Java</li>
                            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Web development, Android App development</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>MBTI result: INTJ</li>
                    <p class="paragraph">Hoang Linh is an Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging person. He is similar to me in the aspect that we enjoy being by ourselves more, 
                        and we use our logical thinking more often in life. However, he is different from me in that he is more imaginative and idealistic, and he is more organized 
                        and likes to follow plans.</p>
                </ul>

            <li><em>Nguyen Nhat Huy “Alex” (s3878500)</em>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relevant skills:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python, MySQL, HTML</li>
                            <li>App Development</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>MBTI result: ESFP</li>
                    <p class="paragraph">Alex is an Extroverted, Sensing, Feeling, and Perceiving person. Compared to me, he likes being around people more, and he uses his feelings and emotions more 
                        in decision making. Nevertheless, he is still similar to me in that he tends to be more spontaneous and focuses more on facts.</p>
                </ul>
                
            <li><em>Du Duc Manh (s3878480)</em>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relevant skills:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Academic Research</li>
                            <li>Python</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>MBTI result: ISTJ</li>
                    <p class="paragraph">Manh is an Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Judging person. Manh’s personality result is very similar to mine, with the only difference being Manh is more 
                        organized and likes to plan ahead. Other than that, he is also more practical, tend to use logic and thinking more, and prefers being alone like me.</p>
                </ul>

            <li><em>Tuong Minh “Mike” Vo (s3877562)</em>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relevant skills:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python, Java, C</li>
                            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Web development</li> 
                            <li>Graphic Design</li>
                            <li>Audio engineering</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>MBTI result: ENFP</li>
                    <p class="paragraph">Mike is an Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Perceiving person, so he is quite different from me. Compared to me, Mike prefers spending time with people more, 
                        and he uses the heart more when making choices. He is also more idealistic and focuses more on the possibilities. The only similarity between us is that we are both more flexible 
                        and disorganized.</p>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        <p class="paragraph">I chose to work with these members for this assignment partly because of our personality test results. As can be seen, every member’s personality result is different from each other, even though 
            some members’ results are quite similar to one another. Furthermore, it can be noticed that none of the elements in the MBTI result are too dominant in our group, so the results are quite balanced. 
            All of these imply that we can balance and “neutralize” each other out, and help each other to improve our weaknesses, which is very important in determining our group’s success, since a group may 
            fail to “function” if some members are too overpowering or dominant. For example, there are two Judging people in our group, which are Linh and Manh, and since Judging people tend to be more scheduled 
            and organized, Linh and Manh can help and encourage the other three Perceiving members, who are rather spontaneous, to be more organized and to plan things in advance. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The second main reason I would like to work with these members is the variety of skills in various areas that our group has, and that each person is strong in areas that some others lack. This 
            is very beneficial for our group’s success because we can work on different parts of the project and easily divide the tasks between the members. For example, since I am strong in Academic Writing, and Manh and 
            I are good at Academic Research, we can take responsibility for the theoretical aspects of the project, such as researching how to implement the product, explaining some theoretical concepts, and editing or proofreading 
            the final report. Since the other three members’ strengths are related to coding and programming, they can be assigned the task of making a demo, draft, or prototype of our desired final product.</p>
