                - MBTI result: ISTP
                The result means that I am an Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Perceiving person. This shows that I enjoy being alone more, I am quite practical and realistic, I use my logic and thinking more (especially when making decisions), and I tend to not be very organized but more flexible.
