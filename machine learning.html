  <!-- Content -->
  <p class=container1>We will first discuss the area of machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that 
    deals with making and creating machines that could learn from their experience to improve and enhance their efficiency or performance 
    (Bell 2020). Some of the techniques or types of machine learning are Supervised Learning, where the machine works with labeled data; 
    Unsupervised Learning, where the data is unlabeled; Semi-Supervised Learning, meaning that the machine deals with both labeled and unlabeled
     data; Reinforcement Learning, with no data provided for the learning process (Mohammed, Khan & Bashier 2017). </p>
  
  <p class=container1>This technology is currently applicable in various disciplines, such as in Software, where machine learning is implemented
      to examine and predict a user’s behavior so that the user’s experience with the software can be personally customized and improved. An example
      of existing software that uses machine learning is the spam detection software, and this software has improved over time since, after a while,
      it would have encountered various types of junk emails and have gained a lot of “practice” and experience (Bell 2020). Machine learning is
      also very beneficial in e-commerce and retail, which is the basis of my project idea. From the data collected by the stores, customers’ 
      purchase and consumption patterns can be formed and interpreted to make the recommendation system that suggests similar items to users. 
      An existing example of retail stores utilizing machine learning for their business is the retailer Target in the US, where the brand collects
      related data about customers to adjust customer’s experience and interaction with Target more appropriately (Bell 2020). </p>

  <p class="container1">Shortly in the next few years, machine learning can play a very important and essential role in prognosis and examining images
      in healthcare. To begin with, by implementing machine learning, there will likely be a major improvement in making prognosis, since prognosis models
      with machine learning will be able to use more variables (Obermeyer & Emanuel 2016). Secondly, according to Obermeyer and Emanuel (2016, para. 10), ‘machine
      learning will displace much of the work of radiologists and anatomical pathologists.’ With machine learning, large amounts of data like imaging can
      be processed and analyzed more efficiently, and it will very soon be more accurate than humans (Obermeyer & Emanuel 2016). </p>

  <p class="container1">In the long run, machine learning can help refine and enhance medical diagnostic and adjust medical treatment based on the individual
      patient. Firstly, Obermeyer and Emanuel (2016, para. 11) said that regarding machine learning, ‘Algorithms will soon generate differential diagnoses, suggest
      high-value tests, and reduce overuse of testing.’ Therefore, machine learning can increase the accuracy and precision of diagnostics in the medical field
      in the future (Obermeyer & Emanuel 2016). The second future improvement that is likely to be achieved with machine learning is the personalization of medical
      treatment recommendations. By utilizing observational data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which are records that store medical and treatment
      information about each patient, machine learning technologies can be trained to suggest or recommend individualized treatment for each patient. EHRs
      and machine learning have already been used together to predict numerous results and conditions in healthcare. Hence, a step can be taken further to
      create technologies that can give personalized treatment recommendations based on the medical information of each patient to assist clinicians in
      treatment decision-making (Bica et al. 2020).  </p>
  
  <p class="container1">All of the current usages and future implications of machine learning mentioned above show that machine learning can have a significant
        impact on our world. To begin with, the potential influence of machine learning is the increase in convenience, efficiency, and accuracy of actions and
        performances to carry out tasks at work or just simply in our daily lives. For example, as discussed above, various potential usages of machine learning
        could refine and improve numerous procedures and processes in the medical field, and this can greatly improve the quality of our healthcare system. Next,
        the aspect of life that is most likely to change due to machine learning is how we interact with technologies. As mentioned above, technologies can now
        collect data on us, and with the help of machine learning, they can use the data to detect and interpret the patterns in our behavior. From this, the
        technology can then customize and adjust its interaction with us to fit our preferences and needs; in other words, with the use of machine learning,
        the technology will be able to personalize our experience with it. An example of this personalization is the spam email detection discussed above,
        where the software can filter out unwanted and junk emails for us. Furthermore, a lot of actions and tasks can be automated with the help of machine
        learning, such as driving cars. Nowadays, self-driving cars have been made and developed so that humans do not need to do anything while going on a
        ride. Hence, human-technology interaction is likely to change drastically due to the improvement of this field. Lastly, the rise in the IT trends
        with machine learning and its benefits means many job positions will be created in the AI-, Machine Learning-, and Data Science-related fields,
        such as Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists, to develop and further enhance Machine Learning and the technologies that use it. However,
        since machine learning can automate certain tasks, some existing jobs can become redundant or more competitive. For example, if people can produce
        completely autonomous cars with great performance that do not require any human actions, and sell them at a reasonable price, it is likely that the
        demand for human drivers, like taxi or personal drivers, may decrease considerably.

  <p class="container1">Regarding myself and my family, machine learning will likely have a positive impact on our daily lives and our work. For me, machine
    learning can make my life so much more convenient and pleasant, since it customizes and personalizes things based on my behavior and preferences through
    data collection of myself. For example, as mentioned in the previous sections, machine learning has been utilized to detect junk and spam emails for an
    individual; hence, I do not have to encounter many unnecessary and unwanted emails every day any more thanks to machine learning. Machine learning can 
    also examine my search patterns and preferences on social media to suggest or push similar posts to my newsfeed; therefore, I will be able to save time 
    from looking up for certain things because it will already be suggested on my newsfeed or explore page. This can also be applied to online shopping: 
    machine learning technologies can look at my purchase patterns to recommend or introduce me to similar products or products that I might be interested in; 
    hence, I will have a wider range of selection and I will not need to spend much time on searching anymore. As a result, one of the main differences that 
    machine learning will bring for me is how I interact with technology in general. Machine learning might also be very beneficial and advantageous for my 
    mother and her work. My mother works as a researcher at a Chemistry institute in Vietnam, and her work revolves heavily around analyzing a large amount 
    of data and results from lab experiments to write reports and research papers. With the use of machine learning technologies, the data collected from her 
    experiments can be interpreted more efficiently and accurately, and some results can be predicted based on the trends and patterns of the data. As a result, 
    machine learning can make it much more efficient and convenient for my mother to perform her work.
