    <!-- Content -->
        <p class="para">I have received feedback for my project ideas from two of my teammates, Mike Vo and Hoang Linh.</p>
        
        <p class="para">My first teammate, Mike Vo, said that my project idea was pretty good and relevant to what I am 
        passionate about, but I would still need to consider the competition with the official Webtoon shop. 
        Mike said this is because the Webtoon shop is likely to have higher credibility and a better reputation
        than my site since the store comes directly from the official company itself. I agree with this feedback
        because when we start something new like this online shopping site, we have not interacted with our 
        customers or sold that many goods yet to build up our brand, reputation, and credibility. Hence, customers
        might hesitate to buy from this site because they feel that “Merchtoon” is not safe or trustworthy enough,
        especially when we are competing against an official site with a reputation. In my opinion, this feedback
        is very helpful and beneficial, since it points out and helps me see one of the major challenges that is 
        likely to arise if the project is put in motion. I will use this feedback to think of ways in which I can 
        quickly build my brand name and reputation so that the competition issues with Webtoon official shop can 
        be minimized or solved.</p>

        <p class="para">After hearing my idea, Hoang Linh suggested that I should narrow down the target, or the “scope” of the
        customers, since he feels that my current “scope” is too broad. My project is currently aiming towards
        supporting every Webtoon fans to buy merch, regardless of where they are from. Hence, Hoang Linh
        recommended me to aim only towards fans in one specific place; in other words, he thought that my website
        should only be made for and support people living in a particular country or region, such as a “Merchtoon”
        site for Vietnamese fans only. I do not entirely agree with this feedback, since I feel like this will
        depend on the type and scale that we want for our project. On one hand, I would agree that it is more
        reachable and attainable if the project has a smaller scale. On the other hand, I have to disagree
        because narrowing down the scale would not be very realistic, considering Webtoon fans are all around
        the world, and some countries have more Webtoon fans than others. Furthermore, this would make fans
        from other countries feel excluded, and the profit gained by the creators from this project would be
        significantly lower. In addition, our “Merchtoon” site will be at a disadvantage compared to Webtoon’s
        official shop, since they sell the goods worldwide. Therefore, if this is just a small school project,
        it would be more practical and beneficial to aim towards customers at a specific location. However,
        if we want to actually launch the project and compete with the Webtoon official shop, we should aim
        to make the shopping site available for veryone. Nevertheless, this feedback is extremely useful
        because it makes me reconsider and evaluate what would be the most suitable “scope” for this project,
        as well as examining the benefits and drawbacks of my current scale. </p>
