    <p>After choosing the desired webcomic, the site will direct the user to the webpage for that specific category of goods of that specific webtoon series, and the products are 
        displayed along with its price and the authors of the webcomic (clicking on the names of the authors in this page will lead you to the specific creators’ page). A filter 
        function is also available on this page to further filter out items based on characteristics like color or price range. When the user clicks on the item, it will lead them 
        to another page with a more detailed description of the merchandise along with more photos and videos of the merch, reviews and ratings from previous buyers, and an option 
        for them to buy the good right away or to add the item to their cart, and they can always view their cart later on by clicking on the cart icon in the home page. If the user 
        buys right away, the site will redirect the user to a page that will display the item price, shipping, and other related fees, and they can fill in their shipping and payment 
        information, or the site may ask the user to sign in or sign up if they did not login before moving to the step above. After the purchase, a page with a digital receipt and 
        confirmation of payment will appear for users to print or screenshot.

        This project is interesting to me because I am very addicted to Webtoon, especially to the series “Purple Hyacinth.” Hence, I have always wanted to support 
            the authors through other means apart from liking the episodes. Furthermore, I really want to be able to buy goods related to the series to keep as memories, such as a plushie of my
            favorite character. As a result, I have thought of making a website that sells merch designed by the creators of “Purple Hyacinth” and other webtoons. The Webtoon company already 
            has a Webtoon shop to sell some Webtoon-related products, but there are several problems with the current official shop: they have goods for only a few popular webtoons, the goods 
            are limited, and the design is not diverse, which are all evident when you visit the Webtoon shop. Therefore, I want to create an online shopping site where the creators of any series 
            can design and sell goods related to their own webtoons. This can help the creators to promote their series and gain extra profit, while fans can be satisfied or can show their passion 
            towards their favorite series.This project is interesting to me because I am very addicted to Webtoon, especially to the series “Purple Hyacinth.” Hence, I have always wanted to support
