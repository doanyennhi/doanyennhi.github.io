    <h1 class="header1"><b>IT WORK</b></h1>
    <p class ="subheading1">To have a better understanding of the IT jobs and what it is like to work in the IT industry, I did an interview with my 
        sister, miss Doan Hang My. She is an IT professional, and she works as a software developer at investment management company. The interview
        is about what my sister does as a software developer and other relevant information that can give me more insight into this position and 
        into the IT career. Below is the script of the main section of the interview:

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>Nhi (interviewer): What do you do as a Software developer?</b></p>
            <p>My (interviewee): As a Software developer, I help my team develop new products, maintain the existing ones such as finding and fixing bugs 
                in it, as well as enhancing those softwares.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>N: What is your daily work?</b></p>
            <p>M: My daily work varies from week to week, depending on what type of project I’m on that week. Typically, I start my day doing some coding 
                based on tasks I determined the day before, then have a stand up with my team to discuss issues and any new tasks. Then I continue working 
                and meeting up with teammates as needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>N: Who or what types of people do you usually interact and work with in your position?</b></p>
            <p>M: I usually interact with fellow developers to code together or resolve technical issues. I also talk with our architect to understand better
                the overall picture of how we want our product to be like, and our business analysts who will specify the business requirements and logic for 
                our software.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>N: Where do you spend most of your time working?</b></p>
            <p>M: I used to spend most of my time in the office. Now, with COVID-19, I’ve been spending most of my time at home, where I work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>N: Is it hard or difficult when moving from working in the office to working online?</b></p> 
            <p>M: The transition was relatively smooth. The hardest part is trying to balance work and life since the physical boundary for that is 
                now blurred, with office vs home.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>N: What do you like and dislike about your job? What is the most difficult and challenging part of being a Software developer?</b></p>
            <p>M: I think the most difficult, and often disliked part, of being a software developer is writing tests. It’s always more consuming 
                than writing the code itself. Something that is both fun and not fun is debugging. The most rewarding part of this job is designing and figuring
                out difficult design problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><b>N:  What are some skills that people should or must have to succeed in this position?</b></p>
            <p>M: The first thing people should have for this job is the passion, or at least a drive to work on CS problems, as otherwise it can get tiring. 
                They will also need patience and ability to teamwork, since most of the time you will have to work with someone else.</p>

    <div class="container2">
        <p class="para1">From the interview above, some information can be gathered and concluded about the Software developer position.</p>
        <p class="para1">To begin with, as the name suggests, the position of Software developer involves developing, testing, and improving your company’s software.
            According to Miss Doan, they also have to fix and update software, which means that the time spent working on a project or a software can extend to a considerable
            amount of time, and the developers may also have to update the software regularly. This shows that even when a team finishes creating, making...
