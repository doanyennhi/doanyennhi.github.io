    <p class=container1>We will now discuss and talk about the area of Cloud Computing. According to Mell and Grance (2011, p. 2),  
      ‘Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing 
      resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal 
      management effort or service provider interaction.’ Mell and Grance (2011) also stated that a cloud model should have five main 
      properties or characteristics. The first characteristic, ‘On-demand self-service,’ as suggested by the name, means that users of the 
      cloud should be able to access the cloud anytime and whenever needed, and the users should be able to use this service by themselves 
      (Mell & Grance 2011, p. 2). A cloud model also has ‘Broad network access,’ or in other words, users can use the cloud from numerous 
      places on a variety of devices and platforms, like phones and laptops (Mell & Grance 2011, p. 2). Thirdly, the cloud must be able to 
      perform ‘Resource pooling,’ meaning that many users are served with resources, such as storage, that are pooled by the service provider, 
      and the resources pooled can be adjusted or changed based on the needs of the users (Mell & Grance 2011, p. 2). The fourth important 
      property of a cloud model is ‘Rapid elasticity,’ so the service provided can be scaled swiftly according to the needs and usages of the 
      users, and the capabilities and resources should look inexhaustible to customers (Mell & Grance 2011, p. 2). Lastly, the cloud is a 
      ‘Measured service,’ or a pay-per-use service, which means that the system will track and measure a customer’s usage of its resources to 
      charge the user accordingly, and this process should be transparent to both the service providers and the users (Mell & Grance 2011, p. 2). 
      To deploy a cloud, four models can be used. Firstly, a cloud can be deployed as a private cloud, so the model is provided to and used 
      exclusively by one organization. There is also the community cloud model, which is used by a group of users with the same interests 
      and/ or needs, and a public cloud model, which is open for everyone to use. The last deployment model is the hybrid cloud, which is a mix 
      or a combination of some or all of the above models (Mell & Grance 2011). The cloud computing model is possible and achievable thanks to 
      the development of various other IT technologies, such as the improvement of the cluster and grid computing, the virtualization of hardware, 
      and the growth of web services, the Internet, and systems management (Voorsluys, Broberg & Buyya 2011). </p>
    
    <p class="container1">As mentioned above, cloud computing can provide consumers with computing resources and services over the Internet. According 
      to Mell and Grance (2011), there are three main service models for cloud computing: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), 
      and Software as a Service (SaaS). To start with, Infrastructure as a Service is a service in which the service provider delivers to users essential 
      and foundational resources like network and storage. With IaaS, users can manage some components like applications used, operating systems, storage, 
      and potentially some networking parts (Mell & Grance 2011). The second service model, Platform as a Service, is a service where users can use platforms 
      delivered by the service providers, which includes programming languages and libraries, to produce, develop and deploy applications onto the cloud. With 
      PaaS, users can manage the applications that they deploy and potentially the settings of the hosting environment (Mell & Grance 2011). Finally, we have 
      the Software as a Service model, which allows the users to access and work with the service provider’s existing applications on the cloud, and the users 
      have very little to zero control over any components of the cloud infrastructure (Mell & Grance 2011). Hence, with all of these service models, numerous 
      innovative and exciting ideas and work can be accomplished. For example, there is a journal article that discussed the idea of creating and developing a 
      real-time platform for online laboratories that is hosted on the cloud, and the platform also allows and enables consumers to cooperate with multiple remote 
      laboratories. Moreover, remote labs can also be connected and linked to each other to share or transfer data (Touhafi et al., cited in Zbakh et al. 2018).

    <p class="container1">The development of cloud computing can also be very beneficial and have a considerable effect on our world. Businesses can gain various 
      benefits from cloud computing. Firstly, cloud computing is very fast and scalable based on the needs of the consumers, and it is a pay-per-use service, so it 
      is relatively cheaper, more convenient, more effective, and offers lower costs for businesses and organizations to utilize. Additionally, as mentioned above, 
      users usually have limited control over the parts of the cloud infrastructure, which means that they do not have to worry about maintaining or improving most 
      of the cloud infrastructure; they only need to take care of the components that they have control over, which is not a lot. As a result, cloud computing is 
      very useful for businesses because it can lessen the workload for them. Cloud will also have a positive impact on work and study in general since it can offer 
      more flexibility in regards to study and work. For example, as mentioned above, the idea of a platform for online labs hosted on the cloud was introduced and 
      developed, and this can be very beneficial for researchers and scientists. With this kind of technology, researchers will be able to perform laboratory work 
      remotely when needed, and this is especially crucial during times like COVID-19 when a lot of people have to work from home. This can also be applied to study, 
      where the quality of online learning can be improved, and hands-on learning like experiments can be delivered online, which is very advantageous and useful for 
      students who need to study online. Therefore, work and study can be more flexible with the help of the cloud, and this flexibility would help ease out the transition 
      between offline and online work and study. The development of cloud technology will also create more job positions that are related to cloud computing, such as cloud 
      engineers since we need people to build and maintain the cloud.</p>
    
      <p class="container1">Cloud computing will also positively affect me and my family. Since a variety of computing resources are available on the cloud and can be 
        accessed very quickly from many devices with an Internet connection whenever needed, it makes it more convenient for me and my family to use the resources. 
        Furthermore, since service providers charge us according to how much we use the resources, it can be relatively cheap for us when we do not need to use many 
        resources. Besides, as discussed in the previous paragraph, cloud technology can make work and study more flexible and smooth out the transition between offline 
        and online work and study. Hence, my family and I can easily switch between online and offline work/ study when needed, and we will still be able to carry out quality 
        work despite the situation we are in. Let’s take the online labs cloud-based platform as an example again. Since my mother is a researcher, she can benefit greatly 
        from a platform like this. Not only can she access the labs from anywhere with an Internet connection at any time, but she can also collaborate with other remote 
        labs and share data, which can allow my mother to work more efficiently and effectively.</p>
