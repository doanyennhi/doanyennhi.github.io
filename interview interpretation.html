    <h2 class="header2"><b>Interview Interpretation</b></h2>
    <div class="container2 w3-text-black">
        <p class="para1">From the interview above, some information can be gathered and concluded about the Software developer position.</p>
        <p class="para1">To begin with, as the name suggests, the position of Software developer involves developing, testing, and improving your company’s software.
            According to Miss Doan, they also have to fix and update software, which means that the time spent working on a project or a software can extend to a considerable
            amount of time, and the developers may also have to update the software regularly. This shows that even when a team finishes creating, making, and implementing a 
            software, it does not mean that their work with the software is done or finished yet; they may still have to work with this project for a long time.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">Secondly, we can interpret from the interview that collaboration and teamwork skills are extremely important in this field in general and in 
            the Software developer position in specific. Not only did Miss Doan explicitly say that teamwork is an essential skill for this position, but it can also be noticed 
            that she mentioned “teammates” various times, and interacting with her co-workers is also a daily part of her work. From this information, it can be seen that this 
            position and career emphasize greatly on working in teams, and that you must work with others most of the time. Furthermore, we learn from the interview that this 
            position requires us to not only work with people with similar positions and same departments, such as our teammates, but also employees from other sections of our 
            company to make sure that the software being delivered meets the requirements and goals of the company. As a result, to be in this position, an individual needs to 
            be ready to work with different and diverse types of people. 
        </p>
        <p class="para1">A third aspect of the Software developer position that can be pointed out from the interview is its flexibility and variety. Miss Doan mentioned that she used to work
             in the office before having to work from home, which implies that in this position, one can work from anywhere and that the transition from offline to online working
              is relatively easy. In addition, Miss Doan said that her work differs every week; hence, as a Software developer, you may have to deal with a wide variety of tasks 
              and not just one “fixed” work that repeats every week like a routine. This makes the job more exciting and interesting but also potentially challenging and complex 
              at the same time. Therefore, according to Miss Doan, one needs to have some kind of motivation to successfully carry out the software-related work given to them.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">The last thing that I learn from this interview with my sister is that software testing can be one of the hardest tasks, even harder than software design and development,
             while finding and fixing bugs can be both demanding and delightful. However, there are also enjoyable aspects, and for Miss Doan, it is being able to work out “difficult design problems.” 
             This implies that in general, it is always pleasant and satisfying when you can solve complex, challenging issues and see the results of your work, especially in this field.
