    <div class="box-overview">
        <h2 class="head2"><b>Overview</b></h2>
        <p class="para1">For our final project, I want to do something that is related to my interest with Webtoon in general and my favorite webcomic “Purple Hyacinth” in specific.
            As a result, I have come up with an idea to build an online shopping site called “Merchtoon” that sells merchandise and goods designed and/ or made by the 
            authors of each webtoon series, such as mugs, hoodies, or figurines. This will be in the form of an online website, and its functionalities will be similar
            to other shopping sites like Amazon. Users can log in, browse through all the available options, and purchase the goods after they have filled in all the 
            necessary information. More details and information about the website “Merchtoon” will be described in the description section.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-motiv">
        <h2 class="head2"><b>Motivation</b></h2>
        <p class="para1">This project is interesting to me because I am very addicted to Webtoon, especially to the series “Purple Hyacinth.” Hence, I have always wanted to support 
            the authors through other means apart from liking the episodes. Furthermore, I really want to be able to buy goods related to the series to keep as memories, such as a plushie of my
            favorite character. As a result, I have thought of making a website that sells merch designed by the creators of “Purple Hyacinth” and other webtoons. The Webtoon company already 
            has a Webtoon shop to sell some Webtoon-related products, but there are several problems with the current official shop: they have goods for only a few popular webtoons, the goods 
            are limited, and the design is not diverse, which are all evident when you visit the Webtoon shop. Therefore, I want to create an online shopping site where the creators of any series 
            can design and sell goods related to their own webtoons. This can help the creators to promote their series and gain extra profit, while fans can be satisfied or can show their passion 
            towards their favorite series.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-descrip">
        <h2 class="head2"><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p class="property">The website “Merchtoon” will have various features that are similar to any online shopping sites.</p>
        <ol>
            <div class="property">
                <li><em>Home Page</em></li>
                    <p>At the top of the home page is a logo of the site as well as its name, a search bar, an account icon with the function to manage user’s account like sign in, log out, or settings,
                        a cart icon that leads the user to their shopping cart, and a help icon with the function to further assist users, such as a page for Frequently Asked Questions. In addition, 
                        customers can view their past and current transactions from the account function. Next, the home page will also have a banner slideshow that will display any sales promotion,
                        special deals or events happening during the week. Under the banner, any best sellers of the month and new items or any goods on discount will be featured.
                    </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="property">
                <li><em>Navigation bar</em></li>
                    <p>On the left of the site is a collapsed sidebar, which is also the main navigation tool, to navigate users to other webpages. Since each merchandise can be categorized into 
                    different groups based on the type of the merch, each webpage will display a category of goods from a specific webcomic, such as a page for clothing and a page for accessories.
                    Hence, the sidebar will include all these categories, and when the user clicks on a category, a vertical dropdown menu will appear, listing all the webcomic options of the good.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property">
                <li><em>Product Pages</em></li>
                    <p>After choosing the desired webcomic, the site will direct the user to the webpage for that specific category of goods of that specific webtoon series, and the products are 
                        displayed along with its price and the authors of the webcomic (clicking on the names of the authors in this page will lead you to the specific creators’ page). A filter 
                        function is also available on this page to further filter out items based on characteristics like color or price range. When the user clicks on the item, it will lead them 
                        to another page with a more detailed description of the merchandise along with more photos and videos of the merch, reviews and ratings from previous buyers, and an option 
                        for them to buy the good right away or to add the item to their cart, and they can always view their cart later on by clicking on the cart icon in the home page. If the user 
                        buys right away, the site will redirect the user to a page that will display the item price, shipping, and other related fees, and they can fill in their shipping and payment 
                        information, or the site may ask the user to sign in or sign up if they did not login before moving to the step above. After the purchase, a page with a digital receipt and 
                        confirmation of payment will appear for users to print or screenshot.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property">
                <li><em>Subscription function and Creator's Page</em></li>
                    <p>The last major feature of this online shopping website is the bookmark/ subscription function and the Creator’s Page. Users can bookmark or subscribe to their favorite webcomic
                    on the shopping site to get notifications through email on any changes, updates, or special events for that particular webcomic’s merchandise. For example, if I subscribe to the 
                    creators of“Purple Hyacinth” on the shopping site, I can get notifications whenever these authors release new products or if the creators host a giveaway event for “Purple Hyacinth”
                    merch. Subscription can be done by going to the Creator’s profile page and clicking on the subscription button. To access a Creator’s Page, users can either search for the Author’s 
                    name in the search bar or as mentioned above, they can click on the authors’ names under the specific goods that were created or designed by them.</p>
            </div>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="box-skills">
        <h2 class="head2"><b>Skills Required</b></h2>
        <p class="para1">Since we need to build and develop a website for this project, some of the required skills are essential web programming or web development skills, such as HTML,
             CSS, JavaScript, and their frameworks like Bootstrap. It is relatively easy and quick to be proficient at HTML and CSS, but JavaScript and Bootstrap are a bit harder to learn and master. 
             For the project, we also need some database skills like creating and managing databases for users and items and writing queries. We should also know about database schemas and SQL (Structured 
             Query Language), which is also not too difficult to learn and understand. All of the skills above can be obtained by reading tutorials, documentation, books, and watching online videos, 
             albeit some skills like JavaScript and Bootstrap might require more effort and practice to be skillful at.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-tools">
        <h2 class="head2"><b>Tools and Technologies</b></h2>
        <p class="para1">As mentioned in the Skills section, we need to be proficient at HTML, CSS, JavaScript and their frameworks to build the online shopping site. To write these files, a text 
            editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, are needed. After writing the files, we will need a web server to host our website, such as GitHub or RSync. The last important tool for the project 
            is a web browser to browse our website like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer (MDN 2020). Since we are also working with databases and SQL, SQL editors like MySQL or Microsoft SQL are needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-outcome">
        <h2 class="head2"><b>Outcome</b></h2>
        <p class="para1">If the project is successful, the outcome will be a place or site where Webtoon creators can sell goods and Webtoon fans can buy merchandise to show their passion and dedication
            towards their favorite webtoon series, and to support their favorite authors and artists. This project can also partially solve the current issues with the Webtoon official shop since the site “Merchtoon”
            will offer more diverse products with a variety of designs made by the creators themselves, and readers can financially support their favorite authors. The main impact from this project is that the 
            creators can further promote and increase the exposure of their series to fans of other webtoons, and potentially get more recognition by selling goods. For example, a fan from a different webtoon story 
            can become aware of and interested in the webcomic “Purple Hyacinth” after seeing its items and goods on “Merchtoon.”</p>
